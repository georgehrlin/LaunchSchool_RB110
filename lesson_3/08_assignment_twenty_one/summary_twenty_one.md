- 52 cards in total in the deck
  - Four suits of ace, 2 to 10, jack, queen, king
  - Jack, queen, and king each is worth 10
  - Ace is worth 1 or 11
- Win/loss condition
  - Having a total > 21 when drawing means bust (immediate loss)
  - Player/dealer who has the higher total at the end of the round
- Value of ace
  - The value of an ace (or multiple aces at hand) is determined each time a new card is drawn
  - With an ace in hand, if the total is <= 21 with the inclusion of the newly drawn card, then the ace is worth 11
  - If the total is > 21 instead if the ace was worth 11, the ace is worth 1 instead
  - Example: [2, 3, ace1, ace2]
    - Assuming ace2 is the new card drawn
    - ace1 is worth 11 and ace2 is worth 1 
    - Because if both ace1 and ace2 were worth 11, the total > 21
    - Therefore either ace1 or ace2 must be worth 1 and the other 11
- Setup
  - Player versus dealer
  - Both are dealt 2 cards initially
  - Player can see both of his own cards, but only one of dealer's cards
- Player's turn
  - Hit/stay
  - Hit
    - Player draws a card
    - Busts (player loses) if the total > 21
    - Player can continue to hit for as many times as he wants
      - Until player stays or busts
  - Stay
    - Deal's turn then begins
- Dealer's turn
  - Dealer has to hit until his total is >= 17
  - Once total >= 17, dealer can stay
  - If dealer busts, player wins
- Once both player and dealer stay
  - Totals are compared. Higher total wins
